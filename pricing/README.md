# Reinforcement Learning in Pricing

Approximate plan:
* For [reasons](https://sjmielke.com/jax-purify.htm) I would like to start with the Trax [PolicyTrainer](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/master/trax/rl/training.py#L244) reference implementation
* The pricing-specific RL implementation utilizes DQN which has an implementation [here](https://github.com/ikatsov/tensor-house/blob/master/pricing/price-optimization-using-dqn-reinforcement-learning.ipynb)
* More JAX-specific RL implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/joaogui1/RL-JAX)
